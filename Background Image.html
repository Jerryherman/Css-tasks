<P>There are numerous benefits to travelling if we think about it. The first one being, we get to meet new people.
    When you meet new people, you get the opportunity to make new friends.
    It may be a fellow traveller or the local you asked for directions.
    Moreover, new age technology has made it easier to keep in touch with them.
    Thus, it offers not only a great way to understand human nature but also explore new places with those friends to make your trip easy.   
    Similar to this benefit, travelling makes it easier to understand people.
    You will learn how other people eat, speak, live and more. When you get out of your comfort zone, you will become more sensitive towards other cultures and the people.
    Another important factor which we learn when we travel is learning new skills.
     When you go to hilly areas, you will most likely trek and thus, trekking will be a new skill added to your list.Travelling provides positive effects and benefits to an individual’s life. One of the reasons why people are traveling is because he wants to challenge themselves and wants to discover how they will manage everything when he will meet new people when and finding new experiences in new places and other things. During his travel there are also some challenges and problems that he may face and need to be solved but once he overcame that, it will bring joy and endurance for him in his future travel goals. On his next travel, he is ready and will surely know what he needs to do because of his past travel experiences.
     Another positive effect of traveling makes you feel relaxed from any stress that a person have in the past few days. It is like a medicine for those people who are stressed at work or who have experienced pressure in other areas of life. Because he experiences new and different ambiance, he feels relaxed, and stress-free, and feels that he is free in whatever he wants to do which he cannot do when he is at work. Travelling can also give your “ Me time” or a break. By traveling a person is helping himself to step away from a toxic schedule, it will be healthy for him to do it and it will benefit him physically and mentally. Travel can help a person heal from any stress.     
     Travelling is helping people to relax but it can also be more educational than what we expect. It will always be educational for all people to see a new world, and new places, meet new people and experience a new culture by traveling because it provides new information about one’s place. Every single destination that a person was visited always has something to share with all their tourist or visitors, it is also a way of engaging themselves in a unique and different world and having the best and super fun learning experience.</P>
